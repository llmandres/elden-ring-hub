## 📦 Release 0.11.1
**Released:** March 14, 2026


### 🔧 Bug Fixes

- Fix: use data_start consistently
fbcbdc3 converted the offsets from slot-relative to absolute, but only
in the slot itself - all of the other scripts still expected it to have
been removed and would re-add the slot data offset back in, corrupting
the pointer and trashing the save slot. This removes the slot offset
addition from all of the places where the slot data offset is already
present in the slot object itself, preventing corruption ([e62ae60](https://github.com/Hapfel1/er-save-manager/commit/e62ae60ec290e7e5b8e5242e8997eada664235ce))
