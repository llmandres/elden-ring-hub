Save File Load: 
- Auto-Find, make it work for Linux, search with find and ER0000 plus any ending in the compatdata folders as well as look in the default compatdata folder (How would you deal with autofind in Linux given the compatdata can be anything?
Just do a find and return the locations)

- Also calculate characterlevel and change it based on changing attributes, give a warning if it is not the same before applying and recommend setting it to the actual level (Example: you change vigor from 12 to 15, so your character level should go from 9 to 12 which needs to be changed too)
- Make Health/FP/Stamina only the max values editable, the active values have no need for that

- Implement Equipment Editor item spawner, remove seamless items
- Implement Character Info

Appearance:
- Give option to delete presets/edit them in there too done
- Implement Tab for preset browser with presets (coming in the future) (The other difficult thing i am still unsure if i want to do is a character preset database where users can contribute presets to me which can be put in a database. Main issue is displaying how the preset looks nicely, Actually good idea - humm just screenshot from the game is enough i think, Yeah, gonna have to give users a good way to contribute (i will have to check every contribution manually anyways) and a way for me to update the db wo having to update the tool, i'm sure i can host it somewhere)

World State: done
- Implement World State
- Implement Teleportation feature with dropdown list of all known locations (give documentation txt for that) / also the option to type in custom coords with a warning ofc


Event Flags: done
- Implement event flag load
- Add documentatio
- Expand common scripts to be used / split up in categories/tabs if needed

Gestures&Regions: done
- Implement together with documentation and unlocking features

Hex Editor:
- Make it scrollable and editable

Save File Fixer: 
- make sure to implement the disable dlc flag function
- make sure all the fixes work

Security:
- add manifest and version_info file

-- change design so that you don't have to expand the window that much sometimes to see everything

-- ng + state editor/changer

## 15. SOURCE REFERENCES

### From ER-Save-Lib (Rust)
Primary reference implementation for save file structure:
- `save.rs`: Save file container, platform detection, checksum handling
- `user_data_x.rs`: Character slot structure (UserDataX)
- `user_data_10.rs`: Common data, SteamID, ProfileSummary
- `user_data_11.rs`: Regulation data
- `save_api.rs`: High-level API for character copy, profile management

### From Save File Fixer Repository
Existing fix implementations to integrate:
- **Torrent Bug Fix**: `RideGameData` HP/state correction
- **SteamID Sync**: Copy from USER_DATA_10 to character slots
- **Weather Sync**: AreaID from MapId[3]
- **Time Sync**: Calculate from ProfileSummary.seconds_played
- **Ranni Soft-lock Fix**: Event flag manipulation (flag 1034500738 + 31 progression flags)
- **Warp Sickness Fixes**: 5 variants (Radahn alive/dead, Morgott, Radagon, Sealing Tree)
- **DLC Detection**: MapId check for Shadow of the Erdtree areas
- **Checksum Recalculation**: MD5 per slot + USER_DATA_10

### From 010 Editor Template (SL2.bt)
Binary structure definitions:
- All struct layouts with exact offsets
- Field types and sizes
- Enum definitions (WeatherType, HorseState, CharacterType, etc.)
- Variable-length structure handling (Gaitem, Inventory)
- Assertions for data validation

### From Cheat Engine Scripts
Event flag research:
- `EventFlag_code.cea`: Flag access via BST tree traversal
- `Ranni_s_Tower_Fix.cea`: Ranni quest flag IDs and fix logic
- Event flag divisor (8000)
- Block descriptor structure
- BST node structure for flag lookup

### From Community Research
- `eventflag_bst.txt`: Block ID to offset mapping (151K entries)
- `event_flags_er.txt`: Known flag IDs with descriptions
- Item ID databases
- Boss/Grace flag mappings
- Quest stage definitions

### Parser Expansion Needed
Areas where current parser needs extension:
1. **Gaitem Resolution**: Full item_id lookup from gaitem_handle
2. **Inventory Modification**: Add/remove items with proper handle allocation
3. **Write-back System**: Track all offsets for field-level writes
4. **USER_DATA_11**: Regulation data parsing (low priority)
5. **PS Format**: PlayStation-specific differences
6. **Version Handling**: Older save versions (pre-DLC, version <= 81)

---

## 16. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Offset Tracking
Every parsed structure must track its file offset for write-back:
```python
@dataclass
class TrackedField:
    value: Any
    offset: int      # Absolute file offset
    size: int        # Field size in bytes
    dirty: bool = False  # Modified since load
```

### Checksum Regions
```
Slot 0:  0x300      - 0x28030F   (checksum at 0x300)
Slot 1:  0x280310   - 0x50031F   (checksum at 0x280310)
...
Slot 9:  0x1680390  - 0x190039F  (checksum at 0x1680390)
UD10:    0x19003A0  - 0x1F003AF  (checksum at 0x19003A0)
```

### Event Flag Calculation
```python
def get_flag_position(flag_id: int, bst_map: dict) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Returns (byte_offset, bit_index) within event_flags block"""
    divisor = 8000
    block = flag_id // divisor
    index = flag_id - block * divisor
    
    if block not in bst_map:
        raise ValueError(f"Block {block} not in BST")
    
    block_offset = bst_map[block] * 8  # 8 bytes per block unit
    byte_index = index // 8
    bit_index = 7 - (index % 8)  # Big endian bit order
    
    return (block_offset + byte_index, bit_index)
```

### Platform Detection
```python
def detect_platform(data: bytes) -> str:
    """Detect save file platform from header size"""
    # Magic is always "BND4" at offset 0
    # Header size determines platform
    if len(data) < 0x300:
        return "unknown"
    
    # Check header size indicator or file structure
    # PC: header = 0x2FC bytes, slot size = 0x280010
    # PS: header = 0x6C bytes, slot size = 0x280000
    
    # Simple check: PC files have checksum per slot, PS don't
    pc_slot_start = 0x300
    ps_slot_start = 0x70
    
    # ... detection logic
