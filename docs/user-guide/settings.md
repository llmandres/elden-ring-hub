## Auto-Backup on Game Launch (Detailed)

### Setup

**Steps:**

1. Load your save file normally
2. Go to Settings tab
3. Check "Auto-backup when Elden Ring launches"
4. Select the save file you want to target
5. Setting saved

**Verification:**

- Checkbox stays checked
- Save path shows in dropdown
- Ready for monitoring

### How It Works

**Monitoring Process:**

1. Tool checks for Elden Ring process
2. When `eldenring.exe` is detected:
   - Creates backup of monitored save
   - Timestamps backup
   - Tags as "game_launch"
3. One backup per game session
4. Continues monitoring after game closes

**Background Operation:**

- Tool must remain running
- Minimized to tray works
- Works while tool in background

### Backup Location

**Same as manual backups:**
```
{save_name}.backups/
├── ER0000_2026-02-15_18-30-00_game_launch.bak
├── ER0000_2026-02-15_20-15-00_game_launch.bak
└── ...
```

### Disabling

**To stop auto-backup:**

1. Uncheck "Auto-backup when Elden Ring launches"
2. Monitoring stops immediately
3. Existing backups remain
