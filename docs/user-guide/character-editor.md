## FAQ

**Q: Can I change my class after creation?**  
A: You can change the class field, but it doesn't automatically adjust stats. Manually set stats for desired class.

**Q: Will editing stats break my save?**  
A: No, tool recalculates checksums. Stats within 1-99 are safe.

**Q: Can I exceed level 713?**  
A: Level is calculated from stats. Max stats (99 each) = level 713.

**Q: Does changing NG level give me items/bosses?**  
A: No, it only changes the cycle counter. World state unchanged.
